This page was created by Juhani Kotaniemi in the spring of 2022
as a part of of the cours mvc at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.

This page contains projects we have been assigned during the
course as wella as reports on the assignments. These
can be found under the /report-rout. 

It also contains the final project for the cours, where 
The project concerns presenting information on indicators
for sustainability, in my case sustainable consumtion and 
production.
